## Beta

Shorebird is currently available in open beta. Many customers are using it in
production, but we are still working on some features and ironing out bugs.

We're working closely with our customers to ensure we're building things
they want. We _want_ your feedback. We _want_ you to
break things. We _want_ you to tell us what you want to see next.

Filing [issues](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues) is a good way
to provide feedback. Feedback via Discord is also welcome.

Our guiding principle for these early days is "first, do no harm". It should be
the case that using Shorebird is never worse than not using Shorebird. It is
still possible using early versions of Shorebird could break your app in the
wild. If you believe that's the case, please reach out, we're here to help.

## iOS Preview

Shorebird is currently in preview on iOS.

You can see a [demo of Shorebird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KDgFvdogsE)
working on iOS, or subscribers can try it themselves with
`shorebird release ios`, `shorebird run` and `shorebird patch ios`.

Using Shorebird code push on iOS it is possible to deploy fixes to any Dart
code in your app, instantly to your users.

Performance and patch sizes from the iOS preview do not reflect the final
product. We expect to reach parity with Shorebird on Android by mid September 2023.

It is safe to ship with Shorebird iOS, so long as you're OK with the performance
and size differences of the preview product.

Known issues:

- iOS apps built with `shorebird release ios` run about 10x slower than
  `flutter build ipa --release` builds.
  [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/673)
- iOS apps updated from `shoreibrd patch ios` run about 10x slower than
  `flutter build --release` builds.
  [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/674)
- iOS patches are proportional to the size of the app, rather than the size of
  the change, and thus much larger than patches on Android.
  [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/675)
- `shorebird patch ios` does not warn for non-Dart changes
  [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/679)

## What works today

All users will update to the new version on next launch in the background
(no control over this behavior yet).

We also have an extensive command line interface for managing your Shorebird
account and apps.
